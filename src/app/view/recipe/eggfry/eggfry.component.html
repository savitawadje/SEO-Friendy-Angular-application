    <p>When you think of breakfast, fried rice is probably not the first thing that pops into your head. In fact, it may
        be nowhere on your radar. Growing up with a my father, we always had a pot of cooked rice at the ready and when
        we had leftovers. my father would make breakfast fried rice in the morning. This is my take on a childhood
        favorite. </p>

                In a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon, turning it until it's browned evenly.
                Remove the bacon from the pan and let drain on paper towels. Once the bacon is cool enough to handle,
                roughly chop.

                In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the sesame oil until shimmering. Add 2 of the sliced green
                onions, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the cooked rice, breaking up any large clumps. Add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, bacon, toasted
                sesame seeds, and crushed red pepper flakes. Stir to fully incorporate the ingredients and cook for 5
                minutes, or until warmed through.
            </li>

                In a non-stick skillet over medium heat, add the butter. Crack the eggs into the skillet and immediately
                cover the pan with a lid. Cook until the egg white is cooked through and the egg yolk is barely set,
                approximately 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place a fried egg on top of each bowl of breakfast fried rice and garnish with the remaining sliced
                green onion. Serve immediately, being sure to break the yolk over the rice so it can act like a sauce.
